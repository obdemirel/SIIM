This implementation consist of two parts. Signal intensity information of the SMS accelerated images are generated by first running split slice-GRAPPA. The MATLAB function "pre_precossing.m" handles the singal intensity information for each slice and each time frame along with the saving format for the physics-guided deep learning reconstruction part. To train, please use training.py and to test please use testing.py. The model that has been used in the paper can be found under savedModels folder. 

Here is the data structure:
RO:          # of readout lines,
PE:          # of phase encode lines,
No_C:        # of coil elements,
Slices:      # of slices,
Time-frames: # of time-frames phases,

Input data:
- kspace (RO x PE x NO_C x Dynamics)
- acs (RO x PE x NO_C x Sices) with CAIPI shifts
- sense_maps (RO x PE x NO_C x Dynamics) with CAIPI shifts
